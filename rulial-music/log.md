1.4

Initial meeting with Wolfram
Write up possibly solvable research questions
Write up project plan

1.5

Setup Mathematica
- issues with download link
- issues with copy pasting examples
Import hangpan files
- was easy to do in web but frightfully difficult in desktop
Split hangpan files
Build first multiway graph in Mathematica
