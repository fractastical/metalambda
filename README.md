# MetaLambda: Elegant Lambda Calculus Representation

[MetaLambda](https://metalambda.org/modularmetalife.html) is a decentralized, self-reproducing computational framework inspired by lambda calculus, artificial life, and graph rewriting. Below, we reduce its essence to a minimal, elegant open-bracketed lambda calculus term.

## Core Concepts
- **Decentralized Computation**: Distributed nodes evolve via local graph rewrites.
- **Self-Reproduction**: Nodes replicate, mimicking artificial life.
- **Graph Rewriting**: Transformations are applied as function compositions.

## Lambda Calculus Representation
We model MetaLambda as a single lambda term that captures a self-reproducing, rewriting system:

(λs.((λx.(x (x x))) (λr.(r (s s)))))


### Breakdown
- `λs`: Represents the system state.
- `(λx.(x (x x)))`: A self-reproducing node that generates copies.
- `(λr.(r (s s)))`: Applies rewriting rules to the system, enabling local transformations.
- The term recursively applies itself, modeling a decentralized, evolving graph.

This concise form uses open brackets `(` for elegance and encapsulates MetaLambda’s decentralized, alife-inspired computation.
